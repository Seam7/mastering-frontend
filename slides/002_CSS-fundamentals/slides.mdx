<Notes>
This is the agenda for this presentation.
First, I'll talk about CSS fundamentals, so that we are in the same page.
Today we will only cover till here.
Then I'll talk about Cascading and Inheritance, then about Selectors
and Specificity, and then about the Box Model.
Finally I'll give you some references from which you can learn more about CSS 💖.
Between every section there would be time for questions, in case you have any.

## Introduction to CSS


* Cascading Style Sheets

* First released in 1996

* Declarative language

<Notes>
>> CSS means "Cascading Style Sheets", we wil talk about what is cascading later on.
>> It was first release in 1996, the same year as Java btw, more than 20 years ago.
>> Is a declarative language, that means that you describe what you want to achieve, not how.
I can say "I want the background to be red", and I don't care how the browser does that internally. >>

## CSS Rule Syntax

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/rule-components.css")}
  lang="css"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    { tokens: { 1: [0] }, notes: "Selector" },
    { tokens: { 1: [2] }, lines: [2,3,4,5], notes: "Declaration block" },
    { lines: [2], notes: "Declaration" },
    { tokens: { 2: [1] }, notes: "Property" },
    { tokens: { 2: [4] }, notes: "Value" }
  ]}
/>

<Notes>
CSS most basic construct, is the CSS _rule_ or _ruleset_. This is one example of it.
I'll name its parts so that we all know how to call them.
>> All CSS rules have a _selector_ that indicate to which elements to apply the rule.
>> Then other part of a rule is the _declaration block_ that says what style to apply to the selected elements.
>> The declaration block has several _declarations_.
>> Each declaration has a _property_, followed by a colon, >> and a _value_, followed by a semicolon.
There are other CSS statements, such as the _at-rules_, but they'll be introduced later on.

## Selectors

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/button.html")}
  lang="html"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    { tokens: { 1: [1] } },
    { tokens: { 1: [3,4,5,6,7] } },
    { tokens: { 1: [9,10,11,12,13] } },
    { tokens: { 1: [15,16,17,18,19] } },
    { lines: [2] },
    { lines: [1,2,3,4] },
    { lines: [1,2,3,4] }
  ]}
/>

* Element type `button`
* ID `#save-changes`
* CSS class `.main`
* Attribute `[type=primary]`
* Pseudo-elements `::before`
* Pseudo-classes `:hover`
* Universal `*`

<Notes>
Selectors define a set of elements to which to apply the styling.
In CSS there are a lot of different ways to select elements.
For example, if we had this element, to select it we could use
>> its type `button`, >> its ID `save-changes-btn`, >> its class `main-button.
There are also other selectors for pseudo elements, >> like the before. This is not an element in the HTML, but acts like one.
And finally there are also the pseudo-classes >> like the `hover`, `last-child`, etc.
These selectors can be combined to modify the set of selected elements.
</Notes>

## Combining Selectors

* JavaScript
    ```js
    if (elem.type === 'h1') {
        elem.color = 'red';
    }
    ```
* CSS
    ```css
    h1 {
      color: red;
    }
    ```

<Notes>
Combining selectors is similar to set operations, but we can also relate them to boolean operations in conditionals.
>> An `if` like this would translate to this CSS rule. >>
</Notes>

---

export default WAnimateListBlack

## Combining Selectors
#### Intersection

* JavaScript
    ```js
    if (elem.type === 'h1' && elem.class === 'title') {
        elem.color = 'red';
    }
    ```
* CSS
    ```css
    h1.title {
      color: red;
    }
    ```

<Notes>
For intersection, we want to reduce the set of elements selected.
>> For JavaScript this would be an `&&` >> in CSS you put the selectors together with no spaces.
This selector will apply to all `h1` with the class `title.
</Notes>
---

export default WAnimateListBlack

## Combining Selectors
#### Union
* JavaScript
    ```js
    if (elem.type === 'h1' || elem.type === 'h2') {
        elem.color = 'red';
    }
    ```
* CSS
    ```css
    h1, h2 {
      color: red;
    }
    ```

<Notes>
For a union, we want to select elements that meet both criteria.
>> For JavaScript this would be an `||` >> in CSS you use a comma.
This selector will apply to all `h1` and all `h2`.
</Notes>
---

export default WAnimateListBlack

## Combining Selectors
#### Difference
* JavaScript
    ```js
    if (elem.type !== 'h2') {
        elem.color = 'red';
    }
    ```
* CSS
    ```css
    :not(h2) {
      color: red;
    }
    ```

<Notes>
For the difference, we want to select elements that don't meet the criteria.
>> For JavaScript this would be a `!` >> and in CSS you use a the pseudo-class `:not`.
This selector will apply to all elements not `h2`s.

## Combinators and Pseudo-classes

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/combinators.html")}
  lang="markup"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    { lines: [4,6], notes: "Adjacent elements: span + a" },
    { lines: [4,6,7,8,9], notes: "Sibling elements: span ~ a" },
    { lines: [3], notes: "Direct child: section > span" },
    { lines: [3,5], notes: "Descendant: section span" },
    { lines: [2,5], notes: "section :first-child" },
    { lines: [5,7,8,9], notes: "section :last-child" },
    { lines: [4,6], notes: "section :nth-child(3)" },
    { lines: [2,3,5], notes: "section :first-of-type" },
    { lines: [3,5,7,8,9], notes: "section :last-of-type" }
  ]}
/>

<Notes>
Combinators help us select elements based on their relation to other nodes. >>
The plus sign is for direct siblings, >> the tilde for any _next_ sibling.
>> The greater-than sign is for direct children, and the space for descendants.
There are also some pseudo-classes to select element based on the DOM order.
>> The first-child or >> last-child select the first or last node.
>> To select an element in an specific position, use the nth-child pseudo-class.
>> The first-of-type or >> the last-of-type, select the first or last per each type.
</Notes>

## Combinators and Pseudo-classes

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/combinators-tree.txt")}
  lang="markup"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    { tokens: { 5: [9,10,11] }, notes: "Adjacent elements: span + a" },
    { tokens: { 5: [9,10,11,  13,14,15] }, notes: "Sibling elements: span ~ a" },
    { tokens: { 5: [5,6,7] }, notes: "Direct child: section > span" },
    { tokens: { 5: [5,6,7], 7: [1,2,3] }, notes: "Descendant: section span" },
    { tokens: { 5: [1,2,3], 7: [1,2,3] }, notes: "section :first-child" },
    { tokens: { 5: [13,14,15], 7: [1,2,3] }, notes: "section :last-child" },
    { tokens: { 5: [9,10,11] }, notes: "section :nth-child(3)" },
    { tokens: { 5: [1,2,3,  5,6,7], 7: [1,2,3] }, notes: "section :first-of-type" },
    { tokens: { 5: [5,6,7,  13,14,15], 7: [1,2,3] }, notes: "section :last-of-type" }
  ]}
/>

<Notes>
You can also think of the HTML as a tree. This is how each of the previous
combinators and pseudo-classes are selected. Here is easier to notice that there
are no lookahead selectors. This means that you cannot select a parent node via its children,
nor you cannot select an element via its next sibling. _show in the tree_

## The Cascade

> Whether you write _custom CSS_ or use a _framework_,
pick _original selectors_ every time or build a _component-based system_,
use _CSS_ as intended or inject it all inline via _CSS-in-JS_ —
… in every case, you are relying on the cascade. [...]

> — [Jen Simmons, Designer Advocate at Mozilla](https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/1039166001013825536)

<Notes>
I would like to start with this quote by Jen Simmons.
She is a Designer Advocate at Mozilla and creates a lot of CSS related content, especially of the new CSS features.
_read the quote_
An incomplete understanding of the cascade can get you into trouble _very_ quickly.
Understanding it will help you write maintainable CSS, with less `!important`s.
</Notes>

---

export default WAnimateListBlack

## The Cascade


* Determines which styles to apply to an element.

* Which style “wins” and gets applied.

* Similar to OOP inheritance concept.

<Notes>
The cascade is the mechanism that controls which rules are applied to an element.
Is close to the OOP concept of inheritance.
</Notes>

---

export default WStaticBlack

## OOP Inheritance

![inheritance](./images/inheritance.png)

<Notes>
This is an example of inheritance. If the parent declares a property, the children can inherit it or override it.
The problem comes with multiple inheritance.
</Notes>

---

## The Diamond Problem

![deadly diamond of death](./images/diamond.png)

<Notes>
Occurs when a child has two or more parents that share an ancestor.
Which of the implementations of `cookingMethod` will `cronut` have?
Java solves this problem by disabling multiple inheritance.
CSS solves it using three parameters.
</Notes>

---

export default WAnimateListBlack

## Cascade Tiebreakers

To decide which style to apply, the cascade uses:

1. Importance

2. Specificity

3. Source order

<Notes>
CSS uses three attributes to break the tie:
_importance_: >> If the rule uses the `!important` keyword.
_specificity_: >> How specific the selectors of the rule are.
and _order_: >> The order of declaration.
</Notes>

---

export default WAnimateListBlack

## Importance and Order

* Importance: Declarations followed by the `!important` keyword.
*    ```
    color: red !important;
    ```
* Order: The order of stylesheets, rules, and declarations.
*    ```
    color: red;
    color: black;
    ```
* What will happen here?
    ```
    color: red !important;
    color: black;
    ```

<Notes>
The important declaration breaks the normal flow of the cascade.
You want your declarations not to depend on the declaration order.
_Show examples for importance and order_.
</Notes>

---

<WFullPage title="Questions?" />

export default WAnimateListBlack

## Specificity

* Each selector has a value of this form `a:b:c:d`
* `1:0:0:0` Inline styles
    ```
    <div style="color: red;">
    ```
* `0:1:0:0` IDs
    ```
    #root
    ```
* `0:0:1:0` Class, attribute, or pseudo-class
    ```
    .class [attr] :first-of-type
    ```
* `0:0:0:1` Element or pseudo-element
    ```
    div ::before
    ```

<Notes>
Specificity is one of the most complex topics in CSS.
Specificity is defined by a four layered value. The first value comes from
the inline styles. The next value is the number of IDs the selector has.
Then we have the number of classes, attributes, or pseudo-classes.
And finally the number of elements or pseudo-elements.
There is no way that several classes beat a single id selector.
To have maintainable CSS, you should try to keep the specificity low.
</Notes>

<WFullPage title="Questions?" />

export default WAnimateListBlack

## CSS Inheritance

* What happens when no value is assigned?
* Some properties inherit the value from its direct parent, `color`.
* Not all properties are inherited, `border`.
* Use the `inherit` keyword to override other rules.
* For non-inherited properties, use `initial` to reset them.

<Notes>
> "In CSS, inheritance controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element."
Inheritance also helps us keep the CSS DRY.
</Notes>

<WSection title="Box Model" />
---

export default WStaticBlack

## Box Model

Each HTML element can be represented by a rectangle, or box.

![inheritance](./images/box-model.png)

<Notes>
Recap, all the previous topics referred to the selector part of a CSS rule.
Now we will start introducing some properties to make CSS declarations.
The first properties we will introduce are `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.
These properties define the _box model_.
Margin affects other content interacting with the box.
Padding is the inner space.
</Notes>

---

export default WAnimateListBlack

## Margin and Padding Shorthand

* One value  `□`
    ```
    margin: 5px;
    ```
* Two values  `+`
    ```
    margin: 0 5px;
    ```
* Three values  `÷`
    ```
    margin: 1px 0 3px;
    ```
* Four values  `◇`
    ```
    margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;
    ```

<Notes>
1 value assigns to all edges the same value.
2 values assigns the first value to the top-bottom and the second one to the left-right.
3 values, the first value is for top, the second for left-right, and the last for bottom.
4 values lists the values clockwise, top, right, bottom, left.
From CSS & CSS3 by Robin Nixon.
</Notes>
---

export default WAnimateListBlack

## Border Shorthand

* Borders have style, color, and width.
* Set all at the same time.
    ```
    border: 1px solid black;
    ```
* Use separated declarations.
    ```
    border-width: 1px;
    border-style: dashed;
    border-color: pink;
    ```
* They use the same shorthands as `margin`.
    ```
    border-style: dashed groove double dotted;
    ```

---

export default WAnimateListBlack

## Display

* Take the whole width.
    ```
    display: block;
    ```
* Inline element with no height nor width.
    ```
    display: inline;
    ```
* Inline element with height and width.
    ```
    display: inline-block;
    ```
* Others.
    ```
    display: none;
    display: flex;
    ```

<Notes>
_Leave presenters mode_
Note that the margins are not displayed twice, this is known as "Margin collapsing".
Margin collapsing only happens vertically. If you have two block elements with
`margin: 4px 0;`, the vertical space between them would be only 4px.
