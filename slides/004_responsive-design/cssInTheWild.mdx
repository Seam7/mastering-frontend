# Frameworks

(picture of Bootstrap, bulma, iota, ...)

<Notes>
  There are a lot of CSS frameworks, most of them
  are written in a preprocessor language like SASS or LESS,
  and also expose a options for configurating the output CSS.
</Notes>

---

# Is it a good idea to use a CSS Framework?

<Notes>
  Maybe you'll think stuff like:

  It'll just make my bundle size bigger! Nooo
  CSS is soo easy, I'll just roll out my own grid

  Ask: If you were making a new frontend app, would you use
  a JS framework/library? (react or vue)

  So why not doing the same with CSS? frameworks have lots of
  problems we'll face solved out of the box, like making a grid
  or buttons for example

# Tips on using CSS frameworks

---

## Dont just include the minified CSS

<Notes>
  Including the Minified CSS is like using lodash and importing everything
  You're just making your bundle bigger and not using the whole package.
</Notes>

---

## Include only the modules you need

<Notes>
  More often than not, there's a configuration option for what you're
  working on, so be sure to check them all!
</Notes>

---

## Always check the configuration options twice

<Notes>
  This is similar to the first point, don't waste space. Also, you could
  spend some time implementing/overriding something the framework already
  does for you trough configuration.

# CSS Methodologies

<ImageGrid
  images={[
    './images/itcss.png',
    './images/smacss.jpg',
    './images/oocss.jpg',
    './images/bem.jpeg',
  ]}
/>

<Notes>
  Showcase examples of some methodologies, and then mention
  we'll be focusing on using the BEM naming convention.
</Notes>

# BEM

## http://getbem.com/introduction/

<Notes>
  BEM is a complete methodology, but we'll be focusing on the
  naming convention. Why BEM? BEM is one of the most widely used naming
  conventions.
</Notes>

---

```scss
.block-name {}
.block-name__element-name {}
.block-name__element-name--modifier-name {}
.block-name--modifier-name {}
```

# Sites using BEM

```
const Card = ({ img, text }) => {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <img className="card__image" src={img} />
      <p className="card__text">{text}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Notes>
  If you are using React or Vue, then your component is the block.
  Each tag in your component is an element.
