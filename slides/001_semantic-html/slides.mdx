# Semantic HTML
### is HTML code that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation

# Let's make a
## quick exercise
<Notes>
  Everybody raise your hand, as we go through HTML tags if you don't
  recognize an element you stop raising your hand and keep it that
  way for the rest of the exercise.

  If someone is raising its hand at the end,

<Notes>
  Fun fact for the people that thought it was the ruby tag.

  It actually is used mostly in japanese, it attaches an anottation to indicate
  the pronunciation or meaning of the corresponding characters.

  But well in conclusion...

# Short answer

## When it gives us a better context

### To provide more information about the contents,
## useful for...
### Humans
### Machines
### Machines that help humans
<Notes>
  When other developers see your semantic HTML code they will
  be grateful for that extra context.
  Search engines like google can benefit from extracting the data
  that you want them to see instead of they guessing its context.
  Assistive technology like screen readers will give more information
  to humans with disabilities, we will se an example of that later.

# Auditing your page
### Read your HTML code like you where
### reading a menu of a restaurant or a coffee shop

### Hierarchy
### Well defined sections

---
export default Split

![](./images/menu-beer.jpg)

### It can be more complex
### Even different styled elements
### are in their semantic section

---
export default WLayout1

### This is how it feels when you read a
### non semantic HTML code
---
export default Split

### No Hierarchy
### Confusing sections

# 3 signs that your site
## needs to be pimped

- The elements are too generic
- Using semantic tags for styling purposes
- Site structure differs from planned
